// More practice with conditionals

// This code runs successfully and produces the Output: "The condition is false."
// It doesn't seem to matter if I put semicolons after each console.log line as is given as an example.  The code executes // successfully in both cases.

// If the first line of the code is changed to (3 === 3) then the "if" instruction is executed and the Output is "The // // condition is true."

//if (3 === 0)
//{
//    console.log("The condition is true.");
//}
//else
//{
//    console.log("The condition is false.");
//}




// if / else template

//if (condition) 
//{
//    // if condition is true
//    // do this code
//}
//else // "otherwise"
//{
//    // do this code instead
//}
