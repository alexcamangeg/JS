prompt("Where are you from?")



//What is programming?

//prompt("Where are you from?")

//This generates a pop-up box with the text "Where are you from?"

//The Output produced is the text inputted into the pop-up box in quotation marks.

//If no text is inputted and the "OK" button in the pop-up box is pressed the Output is just a set of empty quotation marks.



//If no text is inputted and the "Cancel" button is pressed the Output is the text "null".

//Then the following warning box inside Codecademy is generated:

//"Oops, try again. Something went wrong with your prompt. Check the Hint if you need help!"


//If text is inputted and the "Cancel" button is pressed, again the Output is the text "null".

//Then the following warning box inside Codecademy is generated:

//"Oops, try again. Something went wrong with your prompt. Check the Hint if you need help!"


// It doesn't seem to matter if there is a semicolon after the code or not, the program seems to run the same way.
