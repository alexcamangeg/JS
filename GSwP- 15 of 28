if (4 > 3) 
{
    console.log("Let's go down the first road!");
}
else 
{console.log("Let's take a bus.")
}


// In this case the 4 is greater than 3  is TRUE so the command/function inside the left and right curly brackets { } is 
// executed and so the Output produced is "Let's go down the first road!"


//Alternatively if the code was:

//if (3 > 4) 
//{
//    console.log("Let's go down the first road!");
//}
//else 
//{console.log("Let's take a bus.")
//}

//In this case 3 is greater than 4 is FALSE so the fist command/function inside the the curly brackets is not executed and //thus the second command/function after the else is executed - "Let's take a bus."





//Computers are Smart

//if / else statements
//These can be used in conjunction with True /False  Booleans.
